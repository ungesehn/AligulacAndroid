Currently a personal project for exploring the Aligulac API on Android.

If you have a bug or feature request either send me an email via the app or raise an issue [here](https://github.com/ungesehn/AligulacAndroid/issues).

You can try this yourself by providing an API key which can be obtained for free on the [Aligulac](http://aligulac.com/ "Aligulac homepage") website and adding them to your `Build.Config`.

#Setup

If you want to run this project out of the box just add a `secure.properties` file to the project root containing the following fields: 
```
API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
SUPPORT_MAIL=""
```

Don't forget to add your API key. You can also override these fields directly in the build.gradle. This is just for convenience on my side.
